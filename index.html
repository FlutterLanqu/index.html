  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: April 8, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Glass Etching Notes ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application created by Luuk Spronk, designed to help glass engraving artists document and manage their design ideas. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how the app handles your information.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect any personal data from users. All notes and designs created in the app are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded or shared externally.</p>

  <h2>3. Access to Device Features</h2>
  <p>The app may request access to your device’s camera and photo library to allow you to attach reference images to your notes. This access is strictly local and used only for in-app functionality. We do not access or transmit any of this data outside the app.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use <strong>OneSignal</strong> for push notifications. OneSignal may collect anonymous device data (such as device tokens) necessary to deliver notifications. Please review <a href="https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy" target="_blank">OneSignal’s Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>

  <h2>5. GDPR Compliance</h2>
  <p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), users in the European Union have the right to request access to or deletion of any personal data we may hold. However, since the app does not collect personal data, such requests may not apply. For concerns related to OneSignal, please refer to their privacy policy directly.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of your locally stored data. However, the security of data stored on your device is also your responsibility.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your data, you can contact the developer:</p>
